There is this popular matrix that I was introduced to a long time ago but I all but ignored it till now. 
It is the known-unknown matrix:

I am thinking a lot about this lately primarily because I think the function of moving items from "Unknown-Knowns" to either "Known-Unknowns" or even "Known-Known" is a function of how I apply my "attention".

The things/ideas/lessons/skills in the "Unknown-knowns" quadrant are very dangerous, since for one I am not aware of the biases I have but also if I am succeeding, it creates imposter syndrome. 

This is also where getting good actionable feedback comes into the picture. 
I want to identify my biases or "unwares", and to do that I want to get better at asking questions that bring these forward.
