I recently got married and while the event was a success in my opinion, I realised something. Humans, and me especially, shy away from planning the big stuff. 

I attended two more weddings soon after (It is wedding season after-all) and there I realised that there were things that I could have done had I planned the stuff better. 

All kudos to my wife for planning the event, but I could see the stress in her face and couldn't help but feel a bit guilty for the lack of planning on my part. In my defence, *I thought I did plan a ton, but I couldn't really focus, I didn't have enough time and well you cannot really expect everything to go right.*

But, then when do we have enough time? And did I really plan or am I just consoling myself. 

I have this habit, of focussing on the smaller stuff. I can plan a day really well. A week? perhaps. A month or year, oh boy do I struggle at that. 

What triggered this ramble is my excuse of not having the *time* to plan? It all rushed onto me. 

Today a colleague died. He wasn't very old. I bet he thought he did not have enough time to plan his life properly. He would look at other people's lives and think I should have/could have done that, had only I had more time. 

I shudder to think if that happened to me. 
Let's plan for the big stuff in life Vedant. You don't want to be a slave to time afterall right?
