I had my review where the clear improvement area that was marked for me was that I should be more strategic. 

First of all, it feels like a gut punch when you get a feedback like that because in my head I kept thinking, so they see me as a mule, who can take the load to a direction pointed to but not choose the direction. Fair enough. I should REALLLY work on this. The problem is - I have no clue whatsoever this "being more strategic" means. But I should, don't want to stay a mule.

Fortunately as I was wrestling with this problem, I found [this blog post](https://manassaloi.com/2020/12/09/how-to-be-strategic.html) from my reading list. Same problems being faced by other PMs gives me solace. 

## I've identified these root causes in my workflow which might cause this
- I genuinely never sit and write down the strategy for my charter 
	- primarily because my charter keeps changing ðŸ¥²
	- but also because I "implicitly" know what needs to be done. It probably sounded like a good thing, but is not. Implicit means I might be delusion-ed into thinking that their is a plan while there is not
- I also don't actually work on my craft anymore
	- I've stopped reading blogs or articles or books on product management. Probably because I found the ideas very generic. Sigh. 
	- But maybe because I don't know what I am looking to improve. So this one is on me too. ðŸ™ˆ
- I don't ask questions or more specifically don't question people of authority
	- This is a personality quirk I need to fix.

## How do I act on a this?
1. Create a charter doc, create a north star, plan OKRs. [Basically be better at documentation](https://www.vedantlohbare.com/notes/writing-is-thinking) (In many ways this blog is part of this exercise)
2. Read more books on product management, read on fintech in general also
	- Slightly difficult to achieve. But I have a starting point. 
	- I am part of a few communities, will ask for book recos.
3. F--k--g think like a head of product. What will Manas Saloi do? Although I don't know him, good heuristic to follow. 

- [ ] Will check back on an update on this in a couple of weeks' time ðŸ“… 2023-12-20
