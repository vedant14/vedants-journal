### Reading

- [Table for Two](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=table+for+two&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) 
- [In Search Of Schrodinger's Cat](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/513367.In_Search_of_Schr_dinger_s_Cat)

### Side-Projects

- Playing around with an e-ink display to make a home device, will soon add about it here
- I created a web app to track our home finances, basically a codified version of [this](/notes/app-to-track-my-expenses)
- I am also trying to learn how to make a mobile app for a couple of use-cases
  - I bought a nothing 3a phone. And I wonder if I can use the glyph light to create a pomodoro app.
  - I am playing around with NFC tags to track our habits at home.

### Work

- Will soon join a new company, so I will have to skip updating this section
